# APM

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate component|directive|pipe|service|class|module|interface`. For those who prefer to type less, you can achieve the same effect by typing `ng g c|d|p|s|cl|m|i`. For more details on the different options available for generation use `ng g --help`.

Some example shortcuts to get things going:
  * `ng g s products/awesome.service` - generates a service in the specified path in a file named awesome.service.ts. 
  * In order to generate a service and also register it with a module you would have to type `ng g s products/awesome.service -m app.module` where `app.module` is the name of the module in which you want this service registered. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
